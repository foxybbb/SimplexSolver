## Program
This console application contains an implementation of the Simplex method, a linear programming algorithm. Simple standard C++ libraries were used for the program.
This program was written for a university assignment. Therefore, what it can do is read a file in a certain format and do the output to another file.
## Why c++
The language chosen to implement the algorithm is C++. Because it is a simple and, most importantly, fast language. I think it is abnormal to create algorithms in highly abstracted languages, as it takes a lot of PC resources.

## Run
To run the application, you need to enter arguments when you start the programme. This can be done using the command line.
Argument format:
```sh
start SimplexSolve.exe <inputfile> <outputfile>
```

## Compilation
To compile your application you need to have git packages available for download from github. As well as the C++ Cmake project builder
```sh
git clone https://github.com/theoden8/simplex-method
cd SimplexSolver
cmake .
make
```
